#### Part 1: Play Date (copied and pasted)
```{r}
birth_date <- "05/14/1998"

# Elizabeth Garret Anderson was the first female physician
anderson <- "9 June 1836"

# Mary Anning discovered the first complete Plesiosaur fossil, 
# and other important Jurassic fossils
anning <-  "1799/05/21"

# Alice Augusta Ball was a chemist who developed the
# first injectable treatment for leprosy.
ball <- "July 24, 1892"

# Sylvia Earle was the first chieft scientist at NOAA
earle <- "August, 30 (1935)"

# Rosalind Franklin used x-ray diffraction to 
# discover DNA structure. Watson and Crick claimed credit.
franklin <- "25th of July, 1920"

# Ester Lederberg was the first to discover that viruses 
# infect bacteria. Led to discovery of lambda bacteriophage
lederberg <- "December 18, 1922"

# Barbara McClintock discovered transposable elements (jumping genes),
# and developed staining techniques to study chromosomes
mcclintock <- "16061902"

# Let's also remember a dream
mlk_birth <- "1/15/29"
mlk_dream <- "1963 August 28"
```
#### Convert each date to POSIXct format, using lubridate functions, saving each to a unique variable.  (I guess I am adding a time of day?)
```{r}
birth_time <- mdy(birth_date)
birth_time
# I really dont know when I was born.  
anning_time <- ymd(anning)
anning_time
# I would hunt for fossils in the afternoon
ball_time <- mdy(ball)
ball_time
# I am most preductive with science in the morning
earle_time <- mdy(earle)
earle_time
# Lunch time
franklin_time <- dmy(franklin)
franklin_time
# nasty little hobbitses
lederberg_time <- mdy(lederberg)
lederberg_time
# oof, i ran out
mcclintock_time <- dmy(mcclintock)
mcclintock_time
# This time is confusing
mlk_birth_time <- mdy(mlk_birth)
mlk_birth_time
mlk_dream_time <- ymd(mlk_dream)
mlk_dream_time
# Pertinent
```
#### Check yours dates to be sure they are correct. If you spot any errors, correct them now using the proper lubridate function(s).
```{r}
mlk_birth.1 <- "01/15/1929"
mlk_birth_time.1 <- mdy(mlk_birth.1)
mlk_birth_time.1
# edited birth year from 2029 to 1929.  
```
#### What day of the week were you born on? Show the full day name, not the abbreviated name or the day number.
```{r}
wday(birth_time,label=TRUE,abbr=FALSE)
# Thursday was the day I was born on.  
```
####What day of the week will your birthday be on this year? Use lubridateâ€™s update function. You must figure out how to do it entirely by code for full points (no hard-coding). In other words, you code should work just as well next year or five years in the future, without editing.`
```{r}
find_my_day_birth <- function(year,month,day){
  update(birth_time,year,month,day)}
  wday(find_my_day_birth(year=2020,month=5,day=14),label=TRUE,abbr=FALSE)
# I am really confused by this.  This is the only way I could get it to work without errors. My birthday fell on a Thursday this year.   
```
```{r}
wday(find_my_day_birth(year=2024,month=5,day=14),label=TRUE,abbr=FALSE)
  # THis still works
```
```{r}
wday(find_my_day_birth(year=2020,month=10,day=5),label=TRUE,abbr=FALSE)
  # using Mom's birthdate, it still works.  
```
```{r}
wday(find_my_day_birth(year=2020,month=4,day=26),label=TRUE,abbr=FALSE)
# My sisters still works.  Sorry for all these extra code chunks.  
```
#### What day of the week would your birthday be on in the Year 2525, if Man is still alive? How old would you be? Here you may hard-code 2525. Show the abbreviated day of the week.
```{r}
wday(update(birth_time,year=2525),label=TRUE)
# Hard code
```
```{r}
wday(find_my_day_birth(year=2525,month=5,day=14),label=TRUE)
# Using my find_my_day_birth function
```
#### How many days was it between the birth of Dr. Elizabeth Garrett Anderson and Alice Augusta Ball?
