```{r}
head(iris)
```
```{r}
kable(head(iris), 
      align= c("l", "c", "r", "c", "l"),
      col.names = c("Sepal Length", "Sepal Width", "Sepal Length", "Sepal Width", "Species"))
```
```{r}
head(airquality)
```
```{r}
kable(head(airquality),
      align = c("r","r","c","c","l","l"),
      col.names = c("Ozone ppb","Solar R lang","Wind mph","Temp F","Month","Day"))
```
```{r}
kable(chicks_lm)
```
There was an error in extracting the data to kable function.  It said,'Error in as.data.frame.default(x) : cannot coerce class ‘"lm"’ to a data.frame".
```{r}
xtable(chicks_lm) %>% kable()
```
```{r}
xtable(trees_lm) %>% kable()

This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Ctrl+Shift+Enter*. 

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Ctrl+Alt+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Ctrl+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file).

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.
